              Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you
              have caught on film is captured foreverâ€¦ It remembers little
              things, long after you have forgotten everything.

              Photography for me is not looking, it's feeling. If you can't feel
              what you're looking at, then you're never going to get others to
              feel anything when they look at your pictures.
