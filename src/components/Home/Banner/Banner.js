              <p className="w-9/12 mx-auto hidden sm:block lg:block">
                Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What
                you have caught on film is captured foreverâ€¦ It remembers little
                things, long after you have forgotten everything.

              <p className="w-9/12 mx-auto hidden sm:block lg:block">
                I make photographs to understand what our lives mean to us,to
                understand how we are so much dependent to the livings around
                Us.

              <h3>Photography Is My Feelings</h3>
              <p className="w-9/12 mx-auto hidden sm:block lg:block">
                Photography for me is not looking, it's feeling. If you can't
                feel what you're looking at, then you're never going to get
                others to feel anything when they look at your pictures.
